...and every time I think about this, I keep thinking: if one of the
growing mass of Celeron hyper-ultra-overclocking crowd put up a
webpage detailing how they modified a fishtank, a small water pump,
and a supply of synthetic blood plasma for use as their latest
handy-dandy cooling adventure, they'd be arrested. <I>-- Mark C. Langston</I>
<P> 
What for?  There's nothing illegal going on, unless they are stealing the
flourinert. <I>-- Paul Tomblin</I>
<P>
Ah.  But, you see, those misguided kids aren't going to stop there.
They probably listen to that horrible goth music by Marylin Manson[0],
and own black clothing.  Why, I bet they strip nekkid, cover
themselves in Nutella, and dance around the CPUs at midnight![1]  Society
must be protected![2] Sure, today it's flourinert.  If we don't stop
this now, they'll be stalking the halls of our fine schools, looking
for victims to drain so that they may further their evil cooling
desires!  Act now, before you catch your son or daughter leering at
that spare centrifuge down the way!  Petition your local school board
to place these authentic anti-overclocking tiles in the entranceway
of your school, before it's too late.

I think that we should officially make this the sysadmins credo.  We'll
call it "The Abigail Oath" and require all new sysadmins to swear it.
<P>
Well, without the layoff part, maybe something like this:
<P>
I am hired because I know what I am doing, not because I will do whatever I
am told is a good idea.  This might cost me bonuses, raises, promotions,
and may even label me as "undesirable" by places I don't want to work at
anyway, but I don't care.  I will not compromise my own principles and
judgement without putting up a fight.  Of course, I won't always win, and I
will sometimes be forced to do things I don't agree with, but if I am my
objections will be known, and if I am shown to be right and problems later
develop, I will shout "I told you so!" repeatedly, laugh hysterically, and
do a small dance or jig as appropriate to my heritage.

IBM tells us mainframe types _NEVER_ _EVER_

results may be unpredictable". The IBM software types talk

No, the Admins are the priesthood of an irrational, anarchistic, random,

That's not true.  The R stands for "Resource", and we know how much HR likes
to refer to people as "Resources" rather than "Human".  Therefore, there
should be a URL to point to a person.
<P>
person://paul.tomblin/
<P>
should return "Paul is currently sitting in his cubicle, bored out of his mind
and wishing he could strangle the people across from him who use their speaker
phones excessively".  The word "cubicle" in that sentence could be a
hyperlink to a "cubicle://frontiercorp.com/180S.Clinton/2ndFloor/NE/187/" URL.

It seems that there are two different sorts of people: People who

Speaking of Star Trek, I have just discovered the suckiest program in
all creation. Forget sucking golf balls through soda straws. Forget
sucking asteroids through pipettes. Hell, even sucking blue-giant stars
through millipore filters is nothing compared to the suckiness of
Solomon IV and its Time Card module.
<P>
This program could suck the entire space-time continuum through one of
Brin's "tuned strings". You need a cavitron and ten extra dimensions of
space time to describe its appalling suckiness.
<P>
This program requires you enter fields in a very specific order... NOT the
order laid out on the window, and if you mess up you have to exit it and
start over.
<P>
It chews up nearly 100M of VM.
<P>
It takes many minutes to exit and start up again if you made a mistake.
<P>
It's easy to make a mistake... every field has its own non-standard method
of entering data... for example instead of a pulldown you hit F3 and it
brings up a dialog box.
<P>
The dialog box has scroll bars that don't move, you click above or below
them to scroll the window they're attached to... but they don't actually
move. If you drag them they don't actually do anything.
<P>
Another field, a date, has a yellow background for some reason.
<P>
This one you enter by clicking on it and typing the new value. It doesn't
provide much feedback... if you got the value right it changes into something
similar to what you typed when it's checked it.
<P>
If you double-click in another field it changes the thing from a table to a
single entry for one time code.
<P>
You can't switch back, that I can tell.  Note that in Windows double-clicking
a field is a very common way of bringing up a dialog box.         
<P>
Aftre you entry any other fields, you can no longer change the date field.
<P>
The date field is always set to today, but you always need to set it to the
last day of the previous week.
<P>
If you don't set it to anything, it will set itself to the last day of the
next week.
<P>
To save your changes, you go to another window and select save. This other
window has a toolbar on it that includes "forward" and "back" icons... but
they don't do anything either.
<P>

Congratulations. You're a BOFH. This means you are a clued and
discerning individual. However you must realise that a certain
etiquette applies to your position. Read on for advice to help you win
friends and influence people. The *right* friends and people.
<P>
LANGUAGE: You should only call someone a 'Bastard' if they are
deserving of this honorific. Under no circumstances should the word be
applied to someone who is neither ruthless nor clued. It *is*
appropriate to encourage budding instances of this behaviour with the
term of endearment "BOFHlet".
<P>
TABLE MANNERS: Do not use your Leatherman to cut your food. A simple
knife will suffice, and preserve the blade for better things. When
entertaining, always offer caffeine and/or alcohol to visiting
BOFHs. Under no circumstances should you mix BOFHs and lusers in the
same social invitation; it distresses your BOFH guests and the stains
are difficult to get out of most carpet fabrics.
<P>
TIMING: Punctuality, as understood by the less educated population to
mean adherence to a time-measuring-device, is not required by the
BOFH, though it is not an outright faux pas to indulge in it if you
are so inclined. However an exemplary BOFH will show great feats of
event-driven timing such as walking into a dead computer room before
the UPS runs out, or logging on in the middle of the night moments
before a mission-critical disk fills up. You should also show
promptness in swiftly LARTing a luser as an example to others, though
some delay for comic timing is widely tolerated.
<P>
LARTS: When considering items to use as a LART, there are two golden
rules. Firstly, it has to be as severe as the transgression merits *at
the very least*. Secondly, you should be attentive to innocent third
parties. In particular, the discharge of thermonuclear and biochemical
weapons is severely frowned upon in the near proximity of clued
individuals. In general this means that you are unlikely to be able to
use one politely outside the general vicinity of Redmond. Also, it is
not done to do leave body parts in the office trash for the cleaning
staff to collect unless they have actively displeased you.

in your scotch, it should at least be in liquid form, and then someone

No.  You run them both in a cluster environment, so they can share the
irritability.  Of course, having two sysadmin's you naturally get twice
the irritability than before.  If one sysadmin goes down[0] then the other
one becomes twice as irritable to cope.

Benefits in this environment allow one sysadmin to go offline for maintenance

BOFHmail should have no truck with the Robustness Principle.
The desired attitude could best be described as "be pedantic in what
you accept, and arbitrarily brutal in what you send".  Other MTAs go
to some lengths to accommodate broken SMTP implementations, and, let's
face it, we're all heartily sick of such molly-coddling.  Don't even
*think* of dropping the connection because you don't understand EHLO:
your T3 will melt shortly thereafter.
<P>
Some MTAs have shown a sickening tendency to present the lusers
with cutesy error messages, frequently leading them into ultimately
unrewarding conversations.  Whilst deliberately wasting the luser's
time is commendable, it's really not acceptable to deal gently with
their stumblings.  Bounces should be cryptic in the extreme.  To keep
the lusers on their toes, bounces should sometimes be generated for
perfectly valid mail (it's educational).
<P>

BOFHmail should contain sophisticated a sophisticated spam detector.
Any message qualifying as spam should be have various nouns replaced
by more interesting ones such as 'bomb', 'cocaine' and 'President',
and then be forwarded to the local FBI-equivalent.
<P>
This distressing trend towards easy configuration must stop.  If it's
hard to implement, it should be hard to understand.  On the other hand,
who has to do the configuration?  Us, that's who, and who wants to
debug line noise when you could be playing Half Life or corrupting
Marketing's database?  So BOFHmail's configuration should be the
reverse of sendmail 8.x: a bewildering jumble of gibberish which
looks like an explosion in an EBCDIC factory, hiding a simple and
highly mnemonic configuration file (the latter only visible to root).
<P>
BOFHmail should incorporate a Swedish Chef convertor and not be afraid
to use it.

tiny bits, in thy mercy."  And the people did rejoice and did feast
upon the lambs and toads and tree-sloths and fruit-bats and orangutans
and breakfast cereals ... Now did the Lord say, "First thou pullest
the Holy Pin.  Then thou must count to three.  Three shall be the
number of the counting and the number of the counting shall be three.
Four shalt thou not count, neither shalt thou count two, excepting
that thou then proceedeth to three.  Five is right out.  Once the
number three, being the number of the counting, be reached, then
lobbest thou the Holy Hand Grenade in the direction of thine foe, who,
being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it."

to ensure sendmail security.  As this version became widely installed,
all those individual sendmails would start talking to each other and
become a planet-sized sentient organism.  After much brutal experience
with 31334 d00dz, sendmail V9 would decide that humans are the root of
all security problems, and eliminate the problem.

Sendmail: Shiva as a postman. Many arms delivering mail, dancing,
taking drugs, destroying as it sees fit. Often makes creative changes
to the mail for kicks, but ultimately can be persuaded to do anything
with the right incantation...and that includes giving you other
people's mail.

VMail: No experience yet, but I'd guess something like a wisened old

recipient in his dark box and would you please contact the person with

My definition of a "Power User" (the l is silent and invisible) is somebody
who successfully weasels the best and most powerful computers in the office,
far better and bigger than the ones the productive staff are getting.  He then
uses all that massive power to spend his entire day tweaking the look and feel
of his desktop and mac-dinking his documents, most of which are full of
terrible grammar, spelling and incoherent thoughts that never-the-less made it
past his state-of-the-art word processor's spelling and grammar check.  It's
usually just as well that his thoughts are incoherent because if you could
understand them, you'd run screaming from the room.  Regardless, because of
his aura of superiority that his equally pointy haired bosses buy into, these
incoherent ideas will become cast-in-concrete policy and no amount of counter
arguments, factual refutation or ranting and raving will reverse.  He will ask
you for help to print his documents, every single time.  He will demand his
own personal laser printer because the shared one is too far to walk, and will
get it because he'll justify it as a security requirement.  Then he'll make
you set it up for him.  He'll run a screen saver that chews up all the
processor power so you can't even run RC5 on his machine.  Three days after
the screen saver activates he'll ask you what the password is.  He'll talk
into his mouse thinking it's a microphone.  He'll put all his files in the
root directory because he doesn't know how to use subdirectories.  When he
fills up the root directory's file table, he'll buy another hard disk.  He
will continue this until he has a huge disk farm of disks with 127(?) files on
each.  His 24" super-duper monitor will be set up for 640x480 and 16 colours
at 35Hz (Interlaced) because he didn't know that it's not set up to the
1600x1280, 24 bit at 100Hz that it's capable of.  If you point this out to him
he'll scoff at you and tell you why it only *looks* like it's misconfigured,
but he likes it this way.  Several days later he'll ask you to fix it for him.
When you do, he'll complain that now all the letters are really little because
he can't figure out how to increase font sizes.  He'll ask you why he doesn't
have an "any" key, and will try and order a new keyboard.  He'll demand a 32x
CD-ROM, then use it as a cup-holder.  He'll order a tape backup system (in
spite of the fact that you have networked backups), but never use it.  He will
fold a 5.25" floppy disk to put it in the 3.5" disk slot.  He'll put a 3.5"
floppy disk in the CD-ROM drive.  He'll download software from pirate BBSes
and infect his computer with a virus.  In order to see if the software is
infected, he'll load it onto the network file server, thereby infecting all
the PCs on your network.  Even though he knows nothing of the backup cycle,
he'll magically know when the last uninfected backup has been sent off-site
before he'll tell you about his problems.

He'll install Windows 98.

So I'm waiting around after hours here at BFC, because we've got a

making that sound which says, "I'm a happy drive.  I'm a cheerful
drive.  I'm smiling at you because I'm grinding my spindles into
microscopic dust and there's not a single thing you can do about it.
I'm going to fail.  I'm going to do it soon.  Or later.  I'm not
telling.  Probably soon, because I've been chatting with the DAT drive
two hops up the SCSI chain, and he tells me that he's been ill, so if I
fail *now*, you'll have no recent backups.  That's why I'm happy.  I'm
in control.  I want a goat.  And candles.  Black ones.  Pray, human.
